# Day-to-Night-Animation
This project is a day-to-night animation built using HTML and CSS. It served as an excellent opportunity to strengthen my skills in front-end development, particularly CSS animations. Throughout the process, I gained valuable experience, and the final result was a source of inspiration in my learning journey.
